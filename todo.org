** Problem statement:
US Health care jargon is not easily deciphered by international persons, and is thus a barrier for access to care
** Pain points
 - time and stress from not being insured
 - unable to address preexisting condition
 - time delay between signing up (and paying) and actual access of care
 - limited time window to choose a plan in a marketplace of many plans
** Early adopters
 - international students
** What prevents alleviation of the problem
 - unfamiliarity with US health insurance schema
 - limited resources (time) to become familiar
 - lack of administrative documents (SSN, etc.)
 - lack of US bank accounts
 - Language barrier
